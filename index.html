      content="A randomized sample of participants were asked to perform a soundscape composition specifically designed for at-home lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. At-home workers had a new challenge to deal with that distracted them from the flow of their labour: noise. 

      The great intruder, noise, was not necessarily loud. It was intrusive. It has introduced a jagged series of heterogenous time-scales, a consequence of the home operating in stacks of usually separate institutions: family on work on health on education. "
