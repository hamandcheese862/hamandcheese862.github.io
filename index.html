          This project uses a soundscape composition as a data prompt for
          interview-based research. A randomized sample of participants were
          asked to perform a soundscape composition specifically designed for
          at-home lockdown during COVID. At-home workers had a new challenge to
          deal with that distracted them from the flow of their labour: noise. 
          The great intruder, noise, was not necessarily loud. It was intrusive.
          It has introduced a jagged series of heterogenous time-scales, a
          consequence of the home operating in stacks of usually separate
          institutions: family on work on health on education. The soundscape
          was distributed to participants in order to make sense of and tune
          into the new soundscapes of interruption.  Participants were asked to
          perform the composition, found {here}, to produce sketches and
          drawings of the experiences, and to follow up with an interview to
          reflect on the lived concrete experience of living with and adjusting
          to the new at-home soundscapes.
